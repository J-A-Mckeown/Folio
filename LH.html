    <p>
        The aim of the first prtoject in my UX/UI course was to create a fictional travel app.
    </p>
    <h3 class="neonSub">RE<span class="flickering">Q</span>UIREMENTS</h3>
    <p>
      The process outlined over the 4 weeks was:
      <ul class="list">
          <li>Collect qualitative data through intereviews.</li>
          <li>Find and empathize to your core users.</li>
          <li>Define and ideate through statements and storytelling.</li>
          <li>Prototype from sketch to wireframes.</li>
          <li>Test and iterate.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h3 class="neonSub"><span class="flickering2">EMP</span>ATHIZE</h3>
    <p>
        Starting off the project I conducted user interviews to gather as much qualitative data as possible, view the transcripts <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XdWh0WPBqV02EGCXT6ec9_9wp5__a5YX/view?usp=sharing"><b>here</b></a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q709NDOZEwjGsC5S4n-2yUfbX8lhIvKL/view?usp=sharing"><b>here</b>.</a> <br>
        After gathering the data I collated the responses to the interview questions into an affinity diagram in Miro. See it <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOGHPgEc=/?invite_link_id=561434777560"><b>here</b>.</a>
    </p>
    <div class="LHAffinity">

    </div> <br>
    <p>
        I also carrioed out a competitor analysis on places like Expedia and Wotif along with an empathy map which helped me create my user persona, which would be my ideal user.<br>
        Meet Johgan Sturge, he's a primary school teacher who has just turned 30. Johan loves to travel and always likes a bargain but is worried about the cancellation ploicies in the wake of covid-19.
    </p>

    <div class="LHPersona">

    </div>

    <h3 class="neonSub">DEF<span class="flickering">I</span>NE</h3>
    <p>
        I used the information I had gathered from my interviews and empathy mapping to create the User insight statement:
        <br><br>
         <span class="quote">“Our users, 25-35 year old millenials need to quickly compare and book flights and accommodation because they are busy people and booking travel is usually not a fun experience.”</span>
        <br><br>
        From looking at Johan's pain points I was also able to create a problem statement, the main issue I'm trying to solve here:
        <br><br>
        <span class="quote"> “Our competitors are failing to retain users because they are becoming frustrated with having to book and compare flights/accommodation in more than one place.” 
        </span>
    </p>
   
    <h3 class="neonSub">IDE<span class="flickering">A</span>TE</h3>
    <p>
        For next phase of the project I moved on to ideation. This step allowed me to really hone in what my user would be interested in, I used an "I like, I wish, what if" diagram to allow me to use my user research and imagine what my user persona, Johan, might be after as well. 
    </p>
    <div class="LHLike"></div>
    <p>
        After listing out some potential features to be added to my app I then utilised a "feature prioritization matrix" to figure out which ways I could build features that would make a great impact but also be able to create with little effort.
    </p>
    <div class="LHMatrix"></div>
    <p>
        I went on to use a whole lot of other tools to help ideate on my app, such as a "value proposition canvas" which helped me solidfy what gains could be offered by the app and pains that other apps have that I can avoid or improve. I then harnessed the power of storytelling and made a user scenario, which lead to a storyboard and a user journey map. This allowed me to create some statements for LikeHome's visions and aims for this app as well as what our users issues may be.

    <h3 class="neonSub"><span class="flickering">PR</span>OT<span class="flickering2">O</span>TYPING</h3>
    <p>
        First, I used some good ol' fashioned paper prototyping to get a rough idea of what I wanted the onboarding and dashboard to look like, this consisted of a splash on startup/load and a coaching screen with a main CTA to get started. I then went into figma and made a lofi version with no colours and just the rough position of the different elements and screens.
    </p>
    <div class="LHLofi"></div>
    <p>
        Making the high fidelity prototype was actually my favourite part of the project as I was able to turn all the data I had gathered into something visually pleasing. Although making it clickable wasn't required as this was our first project I wanted to push myself to learn how to work magic in figma and make it more captivating. I created many screens mostly for the onboarding and dashboard using bouncy animations and casual CTA's to feel more playful and attract a more youthful demographic. 
    <div class="LHHifi"></div>

    <h3 class="neonSub">TESTING</h3>
    <p>
        The user testing phase helped bring the whole project together and helped highlight the things I missed when I was initially making the prototype as well as establishing more cohesive design patterns. <br>
        From the user tests that were carried out I was able to figure out what to iterate using a 2x2 matrix, this allowed me to effectively map out what would was worth iterating on while maximising my time and user impact. The matrix is on the next slide but both can be seen at the link <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO_vKN-A=/?invite_link_id=881638261881">here</a>.

    <h3 class="neonSub"> IMPROVEMENTS <span class="flickering2">&</span> CONSIDERATIONS</h3>
    <p>
        If I had more time I would love to just develop the prototype more to show the whole function of searching for air fares & Lodging to make content for my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jake-a-mckeown/">LinkedIn</a>.
